# Gnowee

\version 1.0

Gnowee is a general nearly-global metaheuristic optimization algorithm. It uses
a blend of common heuristics to solve difficult gradient free constrained MINLP
problems with mixed variables. It is capable of solving simpler problems, but may
not be the algorithm of choice.


## Running Gnowee

For examples on how to run Gnowee, please refer to the runGnowee notebook
