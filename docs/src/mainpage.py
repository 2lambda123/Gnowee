# Gnowee

\version 1.0

Gnowee is a general nearly-global metaheuristic optimization algorithm. It uses
a blend of common heuristics to solve difficult gradient free constrained MINLP
problems with mixed variables. It is capable of solving simpler problems, but may
not be the algorithm of choice.


## Running Gnowee

For examples on how to run Gnowee, please refer to the runGnowee notebook
included in the src directory.

## Building Documentation

To build the documentation, in the docs/src directory run the command:

\>> doxygen Doxyfile

This will build the html and latex version of the documentation.  The symlink in
the docs directory for the html index should automatically update.  T

The up-to-date latex documentation is included in a pdf form in the repo under
the docs directory.  If an update of the latex documentation is desired, go to
the docs/latex directory and run the command:

\>> make

This will build the latex documentation.  The file will be named refman.pdf and
be placed in this directory.
